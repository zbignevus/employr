  for each employee in schedules:

    FOR each year

        FOR each month
          IF month is found in employee year
            SET old month day range (placeholder)

          CREATE schedules time worked month entry
            IF start day <= end day
              GENERATE days schedule for each day with default start-end day range

            IF old month is done

If it's a GET request:

start month equals

start day equals today - 7
end day 


If it's a POST request:



available data:
  start range day
  start range month
  start range year

  end range day
  end range month
  end range year

  if start month does not equal end month

  for overlapping months time periods
    {
    start of the old month
    length of the old month
    end of the old month

    start of the new month
    length of the new month?
    end of the new month
    }

  for overlapping years time periods
    old year

    new year

    if start year range is lower than end year range
        start month equals start range month
        start day length equals length of

        start day equals start range day
        start year equals tart range year



      what's the idea?
        If the year switches to another, then make sure:
          old year is not done and has the first month range counted

          if the old year is done, proceed to new year and new month
